# Final Project

I Used these to API's FileReader & NetworkInformation to show off a few things both are capable of doing.

## Getting Started
These two API's are not very hard to get started with one will only need to clone the repository and peak at the console.

### Prerequisites
F.E.W 1.1

### Purpose
To show how the fileReader & NetworkInformation API's
work and how to get started with them.

### Instructions

#### FileReader
    Look at code, upload your own file. See it print in console and on page. See how certain methods in the API gives you access to certain portions of the process.
#### NetworkInformation
    Look at code, see the promise and information it gives up.
    Also, see the network speed and the and Browser type. Usefulness could include determining information about device accessing the webpage.
